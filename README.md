# Glider Instrument Panel CAD
A repository for CAD drawings of various aviation panels and associated instrumentation I have used for my own personal projects. I have cut panels for the following gliders:

* Schleicher ASW-15
* Schleicher ASW-20

I used send-cut-send for the asw20 panel and had them cut it out of 1/8" fiberglass panel. I had the version with a larger outline cut, leaving room for minor tweaks to the factory panel "edge". These are drawn using LibreCAD.
